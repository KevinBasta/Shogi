stage 1: 
make shogi bord (9*9)
define pieces and their movements
define promotion (option to promote once at oppostie 3 squares)

make mechanism for keeping track of movements (current state of board vs previous)
define capture and drop mechanism
define illigal movements (no two pawns in a file, can't move king into danger)

stage 2: 
user interface
react? maybe dom or canvas first..

stage 3: 
simple algorithm to play against
implement already existing shogi algorithms 
ai? 
be able to play both sides
