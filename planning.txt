To do: 
implement piece stands
define capture and drop mechanism
define promotion (option to promote once at oppostie 3 squares)
define illigal movements (no two pawns in a file (drop), can't move king into danger(movements))

make mechanism for keeping track of movements (current state of board vs previous)








future ideas: 
simple algorithm to play against
implement already existing shogi algorithms 
ai? 
be able to play both sides
