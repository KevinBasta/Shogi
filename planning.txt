To do: 
implement piece stands
define capture and drop mechanism
define promotion (option to promote once at oppostie 3 squares)
    -auto promote at the end of other side for some pieces
    -ask if they want to promote
define illigal movements (no two pawns in a file (drop), can't move king into danger(movements))

make mechanism for keeping track of movements (current state of board vs previous)








future ideas: 
simple algorithm to play against
implement already existing shogi algorithms 
ai? 
be able to play both sides




// Notes from bobard.js
// sparate game mechanics from ui
// make functions to reload gameboard and standpieces based on objects

/* 2 player objects created that have the gote or sente property
   to allow for piece movemnts in online multiplayer, offline multiplayer, 
   and player vs computer. 

   The player class can have the properties of pices in possetion, pices captured, etc..
   
   the second player can have the property of a real player or a bot or 
   it can also be a different computer player object that gets initialized instead
   of a player or maybe it's just inheritance of the class player.
   
   look up the input/output for already existing shogi bots to integrate in design

/* game object created at the start of each game that takes the mode and 
   determiens how to set stuff up. */
